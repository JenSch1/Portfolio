<h1>Hello</h1>
<p>My name is Jennifer Schwartz, I am a part of the organization known as Girls Who Code.
  I love computers and always happy to continue my learning about them.
  <br>
  I have a little bit of experience with computers, but not coding.
  I first found out about my love of technology through my school,
  and thought Girls Who Code would be a logical step. </p>

<h2> My works </h2>
<p> One of the first things I learned in GWC is how to make a video game, specifically a side-scroller and the MVP, or how to get your project turned in on time and use it efficently.  </P>
