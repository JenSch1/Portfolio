<h1>Hello</h1>
<p>My name is Jennifer Schwartz, I am a part of the organization known as Girls Who Code.
  I love computers and always happy to continue my learning about them.
  <br>
  I have a little bit of experience with computers, but not coding.
  I first found out about my love of technology through my school,
  and thought Girls Who Code would be a logical step. </p>

<h2> My Works </h2>
<p> One of the first things I learned in GWC is how to make a video game, specifically a side-scroller and the MVP, or how to get your project turned in on time and use it efficently.  </P>
  
  
  <br> 
  <h2> Samples of my Journals </h2>
 
  <p> <b>Journal from 7/5:</b> Today I learned about Robots and circuits, I already had my criteria for what classifies as a robot but I did learn a lot about
  what goes into making one like the coding/parts that make it. My opinions on robotics did not change but I am still equally excited to learn more about robots because they interest me. </p>

  <p> <b>Journal from 7/6:</b> Today I learned more about robots and how to make LEDs blink, I learned a little more about Arduino C which is another new language to me. My team planned our coding very well and we figured out how to add variables to simplify the code. </p>
